 # Balance
 
 Have you ever thought what physics and dance have in common?
 
 Look at the pictures, the pair of dancers keep balance. It's not that easy. Balance is preserved because of their and pivot relative position.
 
 The second picture is a simplified situation where we have 2 weights, and we hang them on the lever. To keep the balance multyplication mass by distance from the pivot for both weights have to be equal.
