 # Speed up the Xmass Tree!
 
 Here you can observe [conservation of angular momentum](glossary://Conservation%20Of%20Angular%20Momentum) by changing a position of bubbles on the Xmass Tree.
 To move bubbles use sliders on the left.
 
 I dare you to speed up the Xmass Tree!
 Let's try it!
 
 If you need a reminder, you can always go to [the previous page](@previous).
 
 To start, allow camera access, it will let you see an object in AR.
 If you can't see Xmass Tree tap on the screen.
