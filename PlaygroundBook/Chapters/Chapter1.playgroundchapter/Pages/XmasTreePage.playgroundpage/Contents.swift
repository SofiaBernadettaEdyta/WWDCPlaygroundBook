 # Speed up Xmass Tree!
 
 Here you can observe Conservation of angular momentum by changing a position of bubbles on the Xmass Tree.
 To move bubbles use sliders on the left.
 
 I dare you to speed up Xmass Tree!
 Let's try!
 
 If you need reminder you can always go to [the previous page](@previous).
 
 To start to allow camera access, it let you see an object in AR.
 If you can't see Xmass Tree just tap on the screen.
