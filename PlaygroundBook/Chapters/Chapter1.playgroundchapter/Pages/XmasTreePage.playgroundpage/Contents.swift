 # Rotating Xmass Tree
 
 Here you can observe Conservation of angular momentum by changing position of bubles on the Xmass Tree.
 
 If you put bubles closer to the rotating axis moment of inertia decreases and rotation speed increases.
 
 Let's try!
 
 
 To start allow camera access, it let you see object in AR.
 If you can't see Xmass Tree just tap on the screen.
